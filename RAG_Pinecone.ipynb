In addition, some\\nresearchers have tried to develop more general objective\\nfunctions, such as loss function [5, 45, 46, 50, 77, 78], la-\\nbel assignment [10, 12, 33, 67, 79] and auxiliary supervi-\\nsion [18, 20, 24, 28, 29, 51, 54, 68, 76].

              "YOLOv9 has about 10% less parameters and 5∼15% less calculations than lightweight and medium model YOLO MS, but still has a 0.4∼0.6% improvement in AP. YOLOv9-C has 42% less parameters and 22% less calculations than YOLOv7 AF, but achieves the same AP (53%). YOLOv9-E has 16% less parameters, 27% less calculations, and has significant improvement of 1.7% AP compared with YOLOv8-X. YOLOv9 using conventional convolution is even better than YOLO MS using depth-wise convolution in parameter utilization. In the deep model, YOLOv9 shows the huge advantages of using PGI, requiring only 66% of the parameters while maintaining the accuracy as RT DETR-X."
